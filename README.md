# Fast MOSS Audio Tokenizer

Ongoing GPU optimization of the **original 1.6B MOSS Audio Tokenizer**, retaining FP32 weights, all 32 quantizers, and its learned architecture. No distillation, FP8, or FP4. **100× whole-model acceleration has not been demonstrated.**

Implemented: reversible inference caches for normalized codebooks and convolution weights; bitwise FP32 residual fusion in Triton and CuTe DSL (explicit CUDA PTX rounding); fixed-shape CUDA graphs; incremental batched encoder/decoder sessions.

Measured evidence is in `results/`. Files prefixed `structural_` use a **reduced random test model**, not the pretrained checkpoint. They validate the runtime machinery and cannot establish pretrained quality or whole-model speed. Residual kernel measurements show roughly 1.8–2.6× device acceleration inside amortized graphs, but eager launches regress. Residual fusion is consequently opt-in; plain `optimized(model)` uses inference caches only.

## Setup

Tested on Linux, RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB (SM120), Python 3.12, PyTorch 2.8.0 CUDA 12.8, Triton 3.4.0, CuTe DSL 4.7.1. The pinned upstream code needs a newer Transformers tokenizer base than 4.57 provides; the exact compatible Transformers commit is pinned in the dependency manifest.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements.lock
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
.venv/bin/python -m benchmarks.baseline --seconds .08 --profile
.venv/bin/python -m benchmarks.compare --seconds .24 --stream-chunks 3
.venv/bin/python -m benchmarks.kernels
```

The model loader pins Hugging Face revision `3cd226ba2947efa357ef453bcad111b6eafba782`, requests FP32, and disables TF32. `upstream/` contains unmodified source/configuration for inspection and small structural tests, with the upstream Apache-2.0 headers preserved. Checkpoint files stay in the Hugging Face cache.

## Streaming

```python
import torch
from fast_moss import load_model
from fast_moss.optimize import optimized
from fast_moss.streaming import StreamingSession

model = load_model()
with torch.inference_mode(), optimized(model, residual_backend="triton"):
    # Two independent streams advance together, 80 ms per push.
    with StreamingSession(model, "encode", batch_size=2) as session:
        chunk = torch.zeros(2, 1, 1920, device="cuda")
        codes, lengths = session.push(chunk)
        # Next push retains causal KV history; outputs do not alias graph buffers.
        last_codes, last_lengths = session.push(chunk[..., :960], final=True)
```

Use `direction="decode"` with input shape `(32, batch, chunk_frames)`, dtype `torch.int64`. Keep graphs/sessions within the optimization context that created their cached tensors. A session owns model state and its CUDA stream; overlapping sessions on one model are rejected. Batch lanes currently advance in lockstep. The first push includes graph warmup and capture; benchmark reports separate setup from steady state. `reset()` starts a fresh set of streams.

Partial final encoder frames are explicitly zero-padded and retained. Save the original sample count to trim reconstructed audio: a codec frame always decodes to 1920 samples. This deliberately avoids upstream's floor-length behavior, which can mark a partial final frame invalid. Cache capacity is also extended by `chunk_tokens - 1` at each transformer resolution so chunk insertion cannot overwrite required history. The attention context remains unchanged. This corrects upstream behavior after the ring fills; streaming benchmarks explicitly compare graph execution against the corrected eager session. Variable-length lanes, per-lane scheduling, and multi-GPU execution remain to be implemented and validated.

## Fidelity and benchmark scope

`benchmarks.compare` records exact equality, mismatching element counts, maximum error, and RMSE, and exits with failure on any mismatch. It compares equal batches, audio lengths, FP32 arithmetic, and quantizer counts. Wall-clock and CUDA-event samples include graph input copies/output ownership; amortized kernel-only measurements are labeled separately. Synthetic inputs and small structural tests are development gates, not proof of quality across real speech, music, or sound effects.

Outstanding: full-checkpoint profiling/validation, broad audio corpus quality gates, long-duration streaming validation, attention and GEMM optimization informed by full-model traces, and a defensible matched-workload 100× result.
